# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on an app I started back in February that stores and displays all the fabrics in my collection. It's called MyFabricStashApp. I'm working with the .NET MVC5 framework, and Entity Framework 6 migrations. I'm working on the full list of requirements on my Github repo page. I Added the Purchases List page and added to nav. Added PurchasesListViewModel for the Purchases List, and a DropdownList helper that lists all Fabrics to choose from. 

**Thoughts:** I'd like to add the Fabric image swatch to the dropdownlist helper, but it is not going to be as simple as I thought. I found a couple tutorials on how to do it and I'll work on that tomorrow for the challenge. [ImagesInDropDownLists Tutorial](http://fairwaytech.com/2012/08/adding-images-select-lists-mvc3/)
